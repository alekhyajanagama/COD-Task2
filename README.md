House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using linear regression, a fundamental supervised learning algorithm. The dataset used contains various features of houses, such as size, number of bedrooms, and location, which influence the price. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house given its features.
Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
Size: The size of the house in square feet.
Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms.
Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms.
Location: The geographic location of the house.
Year Built: The year the house was constructed.
Price: The target variable representing the price of the house.
Project Steps
Data Collection:
Acquired the dataset from a reliable source.
Ensured data quality and completeness.
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values through imputation.
Encoded categorical variables like location using one-hot encoding.
Standardized numerical features for better model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution.
Visualized relationships between features and the target variable using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.
Feature Engineering:
Created new features from existing ones to enhance model performance.
Selected relevant features based on their correlation with the target variable.
Model Building:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Trained a linear regression model on the training data.
Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).
Model Evaluation:
Assessed model performance on the test set.
Visualized the model’s predictions against actual prices to check for any patterns of underfitting or overfitting.
Model Optimization:
Improved model accuracy through techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
Compared linear regression with other regression algorithms for benchmarking.
Results
The final model achieved an R² score of [Insert Score] on the test set, indicating [Insert Interpretation].
Visualizations showed that the model could accurately predict house prices with reasonable error margins.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of linear regression for predicting house prices, providing a foundational understanding of building and evaluating predictive models. Future work could involve exploring more complex algorithms and incorporating additional features for enhanced accuracy.
